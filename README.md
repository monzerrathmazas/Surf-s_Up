# Surf-s_Up

# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this challenge is to help W. Avy gain more information about temperatures trends before opening the surf shop. In this challenge, he wants us to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round.
